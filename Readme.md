# üöÄ Order Process Optimization Example

## üéØ Problem Statement
Our e-commerce order processing system needs to handle three sequential operations for each order:
- üì¶ Inventory update (1 second)
- üöö Shipping notification (1 second)
- üí∞ Accounting system update (1 second)

Currently, these operations run sequentially, resulting in a total processing time of approximately 3 seconds per order.

## üí° Solution Overview
We optimized the order processing by implementing parallel execution using Java's ExecutorService. This reduced the total processing time from 3 seconds to approximately 1 second.

### Before Optimization
```java
public void order(String orderNo) {
    InventoryWork inventoryWork = new InventoryWork(orderNo);
    ShippingWork shippingWork = new ShippingWork(orderNo);
    AccountingWork accountingWork = new AccountingWork(orderNo);

    // Sequential execution
    Boolean inventoryResult = inventoryWork.call();
    Boolean shippingResult = shippingWork.call();
    Boolean accountingResult = accountingWork.call();

    if (inventoryResult && shippingResult && accountingResult) {
        log("All order processes have been completed successfully.");
    } else {
        log("Some operations have failed.");
    }
}
```

### After Optimization
```java
public void order(String orderNo) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
    Callable<Boolean> inventoryWork = new InventoryWork(orderNo);
    Callable<Boolean> shippingWork = new ShippingWork(orderNo);
    Callable<Boolean> accountingWork = new AccountingWork(orderNo);

    List<Callable<Boolean>> works = List.of(inventoryWork, shippingWork, accountingWork);
    List<Future<Boolean>> results = executor.invokeAll(works);

    try {
        for (Future<Boolean> result : results) {
            if(!result.get()) {
                log("Some operations have failed.");
                return;
            }
        }
    } finally {
        executor.close();
    }
    log("All order processes have been completed successfully.");
}
```

## üîç Key Improvements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Parallel Execution
- Implemented `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool
- All three operations now run concurrently
- Reduced processing time from 3 seconds to ~1 second

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Resource Management
- Using `newFixedThreadPool(5)` to manage thread resources effectively
- Proper cleanup with `executor.close()` in finally block

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling
- Proper exception handling for `InterruptedException` and `ExecutionException`
- Fail-fast approach if any operation fails
- Resource cleanup guaranteed through try-finally block

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Work Classes
Each operation implements the `Callable<Boolean>` interface:
```java
static class InventoryWork implements Callable<Boolean> {
    private final String orderNo;

    public InventoryWork(String orderNo) {
        this.orderNo = orderNo;
    }

    public Boolean call() {
        log("Inventory Update: " + orderNo);
        sleep(1000);
        return true;
    }
}

static class ShippingWork implements Callable<Boolean> {
    private final String orderNo;

    public ShippingWork(String orderNo) {
        this.orderNo = orderNo;
    }

    public Boolean call() {
        log("Shipping System Notification: " + orderNo);
        sleep(1000);
        return true;
    }
}

static class AccountingWork implements Callable<Boolean> {
    private final String orderNo;

    public AccountingWork(String orderNo) {
        this.orderNo = orderNo;
    }

    public Boolean call() {
        log("Accounting System Update: " + orderNo);
        sleep(1000);
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Usage Example
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    String orderNo = "Order#1234";
    OldOrderService orderService = new OldOrderService();
    orderService.order(orderNo);
}
```

## üìä Performance Comparison
- Before: ~3 seconds per order (sequential)
- After: ~1 second per order (parallel)
- Improvement: 66% reduction in processing time

## üîÑ Next Steps
1. Add monitoring for operation timings
2. Implement retry mechanism for failed operations
3. Add transaction management
4. Consider implementing circuit breakers for external services
